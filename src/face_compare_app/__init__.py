# src/face_compare_app/__init__.py
# This file makes Python treat the directory 'face_compare_app' as a package.

# Optionally define package-level variables or perform initialization
# For example, setting up logging defaults could potentially go here,
# although configuring it in cli.py or a dedicated config module is also common.

# You could also expose key functions/classes directly at the package level:
# from .core import compare_faces
# from .database import add_face_to_db

__version__ = "0.1.0" # Example version
